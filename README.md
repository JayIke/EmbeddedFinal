# Embedded Systems Final Project: Arduino Sonar Device
## Hardware components: Arduino Uno (ATMega328P), ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), OLED display (SSD1306), and micro servo (SG90).
### Overview: Object distance is measured by the time between sound wave transmission and reception from the ultrasonic sensor. The microcontroler, display, and sensor are fixed on top of the servo. The sonar sweep line is continuously displayed based on the radial position of the servo. Upon object detection, the display indicates the object with a circle marker and shows the distance calculated in cm.
